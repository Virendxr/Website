# Website

This project is my personal portfolio website, I'm a BCA student at Amrita University, Mysore. The site uses CSS variables to implement a light and dark theme toggle, integrates Typed.js to animate rotating taglines in the header, and employs Flexbox alongside media queries to ensure a fully responsive layout. Subtle entrance and hover animations bring the content to life, and a grid of clickable certification cards links to externally hosted certificates.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in any modern browser—no build tools or package managers are required.

## Structure

The root folder contains the main HTML file, a CSS stylesheet defining both light and dark mode variables, a JavaScript file for the theme toggle and Typed.js initialization, and an images directory for all asset files.

## Customization

To change the color scheme, edit the CSS variables under `:root` and `.darkmode` in style.css. To update the header image, adjust the `--header` variable or inline style on the `<header>` element. To modify the rotating taglines, edit the `data-typed-items` attribute in index.html.
